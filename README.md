System-specific notes
---------------------
The code was tested in Matlab R2016a or higher versions on Windows 10 machines.

How to use it?
---------------------

Here an example experiment is given by using Indian Pine data. Directly run demo.m to reproduce the results on the Indian Pine data, which exists in the aforementioned paper.  

The funciton MS_Simulation.m can simulate the Sentinel-2 MS data used in our paper.

Please note that to speed up the model convergence, the optimization procedures of the low-rank dictionary learning (D_Step) are slightly different from those introduced in our paper but they are equivalent in updating each variables.

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data) and tune the parameters.

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
